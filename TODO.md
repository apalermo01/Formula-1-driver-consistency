Planned updates (not in order)

- Update driver names / codes and team names to handle historical data with the aim of eventually finding the most consistent driver of all time. Most likely use the full name of a driver when no code is available or use the last 3 letters of their last name. 

- Implement a key that gives the full driver name for each code 

- Add a table with team, hex code, and year to account for livery changes

- Investigate what the season results would have looked like if a given driver hadn't retired. 

- Convert these visualizations into interactive dashboards using excel and / or tableau
